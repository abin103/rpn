java实现的逆波兰表达式

主要功能
• The calculator accepts a list of whitespace separated numbers from command line
• Once completed calculation of the list of inputs, it prints its internal calculation buffer as a
space separated list and waits for next input
• The calculator should recognize these 6 operators: + - * / undo clear and should be easy
enough for future extension to include new operators, e.g. sqrt
• + - * / performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division operations respectively
with 2 operands
• undo cancels previous operation, i.e. restores calculation buffer to previous state by
removing operand (number) directly or returning first operand of the calculation
• clear cleans everything stored in the calculation buffer
• All numbers should be stored with at least 15 decimal places of precision, but displayed in
plain decimal format (no engineering format) with 10 decimal places of precision
• The calculator prints a warning message in format below if there are not enough operands
to perform calculation of an operator
RPN Expression Calculation Result
4 2 3 * + 10
27 3 4 5 + * / 1
4 2 * 3 + 1 - 10
operator <operator> (position:<position>):insufficient operands
• The calculator should continue waiting for next input once it prints warning messages and
should only be terminated by user (ctrl + c)

输出：

4 2 3 5 4 + - * / buffer: -0.3333333333
3 - operator - (position: 1): insufficient parameters
